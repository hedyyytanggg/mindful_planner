### Annual Plan Push

**When user clicks "Upgrade":**
- Show both options side-by-side
- Highlight annual: "Most Popular - Save $16/year"
- Monthly: $8/month
- Annual: $80/year (show "Save $16" badge)

**Target:** 25% choose annual (better cash flow for you)

---

## 📈 Metrics to Track (Keep It Simple)

### Week 1 Focus:
- Sign-ups per day
- Which channel drove them
- Did they complete their first plan? (Y/N)

### Week 2-4 Add:
- Daily active users
- Plans created per user
- Which zones get used most
- Drop-off points

### Month 2+ Add:
- Free to paid conversion rate
- Days until conversion (how long before they upgrade)
- Churn rate
- Monthly revenue

**Tools You Need:**
- Google Analytics (free) - for traffic
- Simple spreadsheet - track sign-ups and conversions manually
- Stripe dashboard - for revenue
- In-app tracking (basic) - which features used

**Don't overcomplicate.** You can add fancy analytics later.

## 💵 Financial Projections (Realistic)

### Investment Needed: ~$200/month

**Required Costs:**

---

### Revenue Projections

**Month 1:**

- 8 monthly ($8) + 2 annual ($80) = $224 MRR
- Less Stripe fees (3%): **$217 net**

**Month 2:**
- 700 new sign-ups × 2.5% = 17 new paid + 10 existing = 27 total
- Revenue: **$380 MRR**

**Month 3:**
- 1,300 new sign-ups × 3% = 39 new paid + 27 existing = 66 total
- Assume 5% churn: 63 remaining
- Revenue: **$600 MRR**

**90-Day Total:**
- 2,500 sign-ups
- 75 paid customers
- $600 MRR = **$7,200 ARR run rate**
- Total cash collected: ~$1,200 (including annual payments)

## 🔄 What to Do After 90 Days

### If You Hit Goals (2,500 users, $600 MRR):

**Double Down:**
1. Keep doing what worked
2. Hire part-time content writer ($500/month)
3. Add 1 new feature users requested most
4. Test paid ads with $300 budget
5. Goal: Get to $2,000 MRR in next 90 days

---

### If You're Close But Not Quite (1,500 users, $300 MRR):

**Optimize:**
1. A/B test pricing ($6 vs $8 vs $10)
2. Improve upgrade prompts
3. Add one compelling feature (based on feedback)
4. Focus more on best-performing channel
5. Consider offering annual-only ($60/year)

---

### If You're Way Short (<800 users, <$100 MRR):

**Pivot or Reassess:**
1. Talk to 20 users: What would make them upgrade?
2. Is it the product, pricing, or marketing?
3. Consider:
   - Different target audience (e.g., ADHD-focused)
   - Different pricing model (pay-what-you-want)
   - Adding killer feature users desperately want
4. Or: Accept it's not viable, learn lessons, move on

**The beauty of MVP: You find out in 90 days, not 2 years.**
