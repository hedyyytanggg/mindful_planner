- Generic call-to-action
- No emotional connection or storytelling
- Limited social proof
- No visual demonstration of the product

### Gaps Identified
1. **Unclear value proposition** - Doesn't immediately answer "Why should I use this?"
2. **No hero section** - Missing compelling above-the-fold content
3. **Lack of product visualization** - No screenshots, demos, or interactive previews
4. **Missing trust signals** - No testimonials, user count, or social proof
5. **Weak CTAs** - Generic "Sign Up" without context or urgency
6. **No differentiation** - Doesn't explain what makes this different from other planners
